                            It is increasingly clear that Tabletop RPG has several benefits beyond just
                            entertain. Table RPG is increasingly becoming an ally for developing skills
                            socio-emotional, behavioral and cognitive aspects of children, young people and adults.
                            <br>
                            <br>

                            It is possible to observe, especially in young people, that RPG brings a purpose to the study of
                            a given scenario, environment and even strategy. In my RPG day-to-day life, I see young people
                            starting to study biology to understand monsters, astronomy to learn more about
                            planets and space travel in your games, math and physics to simulate understanding of
                            engineering your characters and so on.

                            <br>
                            Furthermore, RPG brings more benefits than just generating interest and
                            purpose. We will see?

                            The ability to acquire knowledge through perception, attention, memory, reasoning,
                            imagination, thought and language is, in Tabletop RPG, an attribute that expands
                            considerably. Because, the stimuli for master and players are intense during a
                            RPG campaign.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Players receive a flood of information to understand a new universe that will be
                            studied and explored through its characters, without counting on system information
                            they are playing.

                            <br>
                            As a mental tool, RPG also stimulates the imagination that works the process
                            creative and emotional. This way the player is in constant active stimulation! Opposite of who
                            just watch a movie or a series, as there is no need to think or imagine, you already receive
                            the stimulus ready. In RPG, you need to imagine everything!

                            reading the complex books pushed down our throats by schools becomes more difficult
                            encourage reading. However, through RPG we observed that disinterested young people start a
                            reading process, as well as adults who had forgotten this habit.

                            even reading history books to pick up references and narrative styles, those who play RPG
                            amplifies the habit of reading. Furthermore, we know that reading is an excellent method of stimulating
                            own thinking and imagination.

                            No matter how simple an RPG game is, you know that you will have to do dozens of calculations
                            (mainly in combat) to analyze the results. This way, playing Tabletop RPG
                            initially stimulates basic calculations with the infinity of possibilities in sums,
                            subtractions, multiplications and divisions. Some other rules use percentage, numbers
                            integers and fractions.
                            <br>
                            Remember that every time you roll a die you will add, multiply, subtract and even
                            divide to calculate the results of your actions. Combining the Habit of Reading with
                            In mathematics we enter a system of text interpretation and logical analysis. That way,
                            you also develop your ability to face and solve problems. Cool huh?

                            This reasoning ability and speed in doing math has a great impact on the future
                            personal and professional person. Furthermore, calculation and mathematics skills become
                            cream for the person and numbers become great allies.

                            A skill that can help develop imagination and our social interaction, as
                            We can “play at being” like we used to do. Do you remember wearing clothes
                            superheroes (or villains), playing at being a police officer, a firefighter or an astronaut?

                            With this role-playing game, the player has the possibility of leaving his sphere of
                            reality and experience the sensations and mentality of a character. Thus, the player can
                            experience the feeling of courage, willpower and even determination that your
                            character expresses.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Furthermore, when playing an RPG character, you have the possibility to face
                            some basic monsters that scare us on a daily basis. For example, the fear of
                            exposure, judgment and criticism.

                            <br>
                            Another important point is that in the interpretation we can also include the player's decisions.
                            At the same time that he needs to “be inside” the character, he also decides his actions
                            agile way. Thus, learning to make quick decisions in life.

                        <p>
                            One of the greatest achievements of RPG is socialization. When playing a Tabletop RPG as a DM or
                            as
                            player you must socialize and talk. This allows
                            people if
                            meet and new friendships, based on a common interest, begin.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Therefore, that person who is more closed and shy gains space to speak and
                            interpret, and
                            the more expansive person who dominates space learns to listen. We teach this as a
                            of the
                            pillars of our RPG Masters Academy, in the area in which the master needs to know
                            to control
                            the players at the table and make EVERYONE shine.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            This is certainly one of the main benefits of RPG, in my view. I see that
                            in
                            our Discord server, people start to get to know each other, play together and then even
                            They keep chatting more about life. This is really cool, as it shows the strength of
                            people
                            with the same interest, in the same place they have.

                        <p>Those who play RPG, most of the time, are people who have a high level of
                            creativity. The imaginary world of the RPG opens the doors to the subconscious and the
                            innovative questioning. When creating a character or even an entire universe, you
                            stimulates this power to create.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            This means that when preparing the game, you as the master create the entire narrative and
                            elements that are important to players. Furthermore, as a player you prepare and
                            Create your character for a great adventure. During the game you create situations in
                            together with your colleagues and master.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            It's a non-stop creation process.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            That's why creativity becomes a skill. Being creative is something you develop
                            and it can take you to several areas of your life.
